- 👋 Hi, I’m @anghelovivo
- 👀 I’m interested in making the life more accesible for everyone and by everyone I mean everyone. Working on helping the world community of people with dissability is a key priority for me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on the microverse program and at the Odin Project 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding accesbility issues to help people with dissability and to projects relate to media and entertainment. I would like to apply my knowledge of creating a new media language into programming
- 📫 You can find me on Linkedin as Anghelo Taylor or Instagram as mr.anghelo_taylor
